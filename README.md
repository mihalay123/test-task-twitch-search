# Next.js Test Task

The project was developed in April 2021. It is test task to frontend junior position.\
The company didn't hire me :)

## About

I has to develop a web app that will search stream videos and render information (title, time, cover). It also must be able to add and save to favorites locally

It was my first serious experience with React. So the quality leaves much to be desired.

## What I used

[`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org)

[`Sass`](http://www.sass-lang.com)

## Good sides

You can see my ability to implement and understand third-party libraries.
